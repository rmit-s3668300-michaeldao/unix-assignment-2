# This script has been written for the UNIX assignment 2, it is responsible for controlling
# the flickering led on the raspberry pi.
#
# For each second we want to poll the current cpu load and have the led turn on and off 
# based on the load to seconds:
# -e.g. If cpu load < 20%: led should be on for 1/5 of a second
#
# Notes:
# - The shebang above is the best for bash portability
